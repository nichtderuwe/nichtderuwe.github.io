# Hello, I'm #NotThe𝖀𝖂𝕰 
####  ( #NichtDerUwe )

This is an information page about the AfD district council candidate 𝖀𝖂𝕰 Thrum aka #nichtDerUwe

Uwe-Thrum is a member of the AfD state parliament in Thuringia and a former candidate for district administrator ["lack of proximity to extremists and so-called Reichsbürger ( Reichs-citizens ) activits"](https://www.thueringer-allgemeine.de/meinung/article241422600/Kommt-jetzt-ein-Landrat-ohne-Abstand-zu-Extremisten.html), who marches on demonstrations ["with upside down Germany flag"](https://www.otz.de/regionen/saale-orla-kreis/article241477038/AfD-Landratskandidat-Uwe-Thrum-verweigert-sich-dem-oeffentlichen-Wahl-Duell.html)  and likes to describe the Federal Republic as an “overreaching dictatorship”.

The “worst thing” was that AfD number 1 Höcke was desperately looking for a constituency for the state elections and Mr. Thrum would certainly have given up the SOK if he had won the election.

Whether the 𝖀𝖂𝕰 Thrum, who was present during the incident, would have carried out this remains questionable.
